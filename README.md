# Exploring-Generative-Learning
Intensive Exploration of Generative Learning through different frameworks/models

I intend on exploring the following generative models:
- SRGAN ❌
- CycleGAN ✅
- DCGAN ✅
- StarGAN ❌
- GSN ❌
- Variational Autoencoders ❌
- Arbitrary Style Transfer ❌
- Style Transfer ❌
- GauGAN ❌
- Pix2Pix ❌
- WGAN ❌

Key: <br>
❌ => in progress/not started <br>
✅ => completed and tested
