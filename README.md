# Exploring-Generative-Learning
The following is an intensive exploration of Generative Learning through different frameworks/models.

I intend on exploring the following generative models:
- SRGAN ❌
- CycleGAN ✅
- BiCycleGAN ❌
- DCGAN ✅
- StarGAN ❌
- GSN ❌
- Variational Autoencoders ❌
- Arbitrary Style Transfer ❌
- Style Transfer ❌
- GauGAN ❌
- Pix2Pix ❌
- WGAN ❌

Key: <br>
❌ => in progress/not started <br>
✅ => completed and tested <br>
<br>

Each program will have a detailed explanation of the workings of the GAN and what differs it from other styles of GANs. (pros, cons, model architecture, etc.) <br>
- This is meant to be a documentation of my self exploration of generative learning, and is meant to showcase my capability of understanding with these models.
